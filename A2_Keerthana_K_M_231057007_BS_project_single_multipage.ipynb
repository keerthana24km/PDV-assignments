to solar cooking. Using the solar cooker can actually reduce the total amount of effort in meal preparation. Also cooking outside in the summer allows you to eliminate extra heat in the house. With solar cooking, you start your meals early in the day and then relax. At lunch or later in the afternoon or evening, when you’re tired after a day of work, the sun will have cooked your food.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Most food, except cookies and open-faced cheese sandwiches, are cooked in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Containers\" title=\"Containers\">containers</a> with the lids on.  Cooking vessels should be black or very dark in color.  There are many types of black and dark <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Pot\" title=\"Pot\">pot</a> finishes available, including some on lightweight pots for backpacking that nest.  One good choice for home solar cookware is dark speckled graniteware. (The 9-inch round roaster makes a beautiful round loaf of <a href=\"/wiki/Bread\" title=\"Bread\">bread</a>). Be sure to use hot pads when removing the pots from the oven; the pot will be very hot!</li></ul>, <ul><li>If this is your first attempt at solar cooking, start with something easy such as chicken, <a href=\"/wiki/Rice\" title=\"Rice\">rice</a>, zucchini, or quick bread such as banana bread. Baking potatoes is also easy, but don't wrap them in aluminum foil; just put them in a dark covered pot without adding any water.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Food such as roasts, stews, casseroles, poultry, potatoes, carrots, pot roasts and <a href=\"/wiki/Rice\" title=\"Rice\">rice</a> are almost impossible to overcook; therefore, the timing on the food is not critical.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Chicken will still be juicy and will fall of the bone when solar cooked four hours instead of the needed two hours. The major advantage of solar cooking is the flexibility in cooking times. You can remove the food any time after it is done. Cooking chicken too long will result in a mushy consistency.</li></ul>, <ul><li>In cooking fresh fish, you can judge when the fish is cooked thoroughly when juice begins to drop. If you cook fish on a rack, it is easy to see this change. Then check to see that the fish is cooked to the bone in the thickest part.</li></ul>, <ul><li>For best results, do not overcook the following food: green vegetables, cookies, cakes, and bread.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Use dark covered pots or pans with tight fitting lids.  With rare exceptions (e.g., cookies) the lid is kept on the pot while cooking.  Dark baking pans can be purchased in pairs so one can be turned upside-down for a lid.  Secure with binder clips.</li></ul>, <ul><li>The golden rule of solar cooking is: <b>GET THE FOOD ON EARLY, AND DON’T WORRY ABOUT OVERCOOKING</b>.</li></ul>, <ul><li>You do not need to stir food while cooking. However, it’s OK to check the food if you quickly replace the lid.  One exception to this rule is if you are cooking an exceptionally large mass of something very thick, in which case it can be a good idea to stir at least once after clear signs of steam appear, with the goal of moving the cooler middle of the food towards the side of the pan and the hotter food against the sides into the middle.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Place the hard-to-cook or larger quantity items in the back of the cooker where they will receive more direct sun. When using several pots, place the easy-to-cook food in the front of the cooker.</li></ul>, <ul><li>The solar oven pots will be hot!  Use potholders when removing lids.</li></ul>, <ul><li>To keep the food hot after the sun goes down, add several bricks or heavy stones when you begin cooking. To maximize heat retention, lower the reflective lid onto the glass, and cover the cooker with a blanket.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Many meals may be cooked without refocusing, and you will learn by experience. Just face the cooker so that halfway through the cooking time the sun will be right in front of the cooker with the prop stick casting a shadow on the proper stick holder. With lots of food, or on less than fully sunny days, refocus the oven once or twice.</li></ul>, <ul><li>To bake cakes or bread in a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Solar_box_cooker\" title=\"Solar box cooker\">solar box cooker</a>, preheat the cooker for at least ½ hour before adding the food.</li></ul>, <ul><li>If you are cooking a large amount of food, it will cook more quickly if distributed between two or three smaller pots instead of one large pot.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Several small, uncovered bowls may be placed inside a large covered pot to cook.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Leftovers are easily reheated, to at least 71 °C (160 °F), in the solar cooker.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Most recipes take slightly less liquid when cooked in a solar oven.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Time for cooking depends on the temperature of the food as it is placed in the oven, as well as the brightness of the day.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Allow plenty of time.  Foods hold well in the solar oven without scorching or drying out.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Focus oven and check food about once an hour when you're just getting started.  Later, you'll relax and tend the cooking only once every two or three hours.</li></ul>, <ul><li>Most recipes calling for a higher temperature will do fine if you give them more time.</li></ul>, <ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Baking_in_a_parabolic_solar_cooker\" title=\"Baking in a parabolic solar cooker\">Baking in a parabolic solar cooker</a></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Solar_cooking_pots\" title=\"Solar cooking pots\">Solar cooking pots</a></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Solar_cooking_frequently-asked_questions\" title=\"Solar cooking frequently-asked questions\">Solar cooking frequently-asked questions</a></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Safe_internal_meat_temperatures\" title=\"Safe internal meat temperatures\">Safe internal meat temperatures</a></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Sprouting\" title=\"Sprouting\">Sprouting</a></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Tips_and_tricks\" title=\"Tips and tricks\">Tips and tricks</a></li>\n","<li><a class=\"internal\" href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/solarcooking/images/7/74/Parabolic_solar_cookbook_-_Imma_Seifert.pdf/revision/latest?cb=20151107204010\" title=\"Parabolic solar cookbook - Imma Seifert.pdf\">A cookbook showing how to cook in a parabolic cooker</a> - <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Imma_Seifert\" title=\"Imma Seifert\">Imma Seifert</a></i></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Introduction_to_solar_cooking\" title=\"Introduction to solar cooking\">Introduction to solar cooking</a></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Category:Health_and_safety\" title=\"Category:Health and safety\">Health and safety</a></li>\n","<li><a href=\"/wiki/Solar_Cookers_International\" title=\"Solar Cookers International\">Solar Cookers International</a></li></ul>, <ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-capacity-food-d_295.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Specific heat capacity of some common foods</a></li>\n","<li><a class=\"internal\" href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/solarcooking/images/4/4e/Construction_of_Solar_Cookers_and_Driers_-_Pro-Agro.pdf/revision/latest?cb=20160127200959\" title=\"Construction of Solar Cookers and Driers - Pro-Agro.pdf\">Construction of Solar Cookers and Driers</a> - <i>Christelle Souriau &amp; David Amelin</i> (This is an excellent overview of solar cooking basics and simple solar cooker and dryer construction methods.)</li></ul>]}]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"BTnr218UYJOF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"orig_nbformat":4,"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
